# Touchpad Mouse Emulator
This allows applications that would require a mouse to use to be operable from a laptop's touchpad, these applkications include most games like Minecraft and Fortnite and CAD software like SolidWorks.

This is achieved by mapping the `j`, `k`, and `l` keys to the left, middle, and right mouse buttons respectively allowing the user to press these buttons easily while controlling the touchpad with their thumb. Additionally, the `i` and `o` buttons are mapped to scrolling down and up respectively.

The `j`, `k`, and `l` keys were chosen because these are part of the touch-typing posture, (a QWERTY keyboard's j key has a homing bump on it).
It takes a little bit of learning but 

## Controls
- `j`, `k`, and `l` keys to the left, middle, and right mouse buttons respectively
- `i` and `o` to scroll down and up respectively
- Press `/` to disable this macro (to be able to type) and press `escape` to enable it again. Both the `/` and `escape` keys are not captured and will continue to work as expected. These keys were chosen because they are used in some games to access or close the chat.
